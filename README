libpnghelpers

This library is based on the routines in the tutorial provided by Ben Bullock at 
http://www.lemoda.net/c/write-png/

It has since received some modifications by Jonathan Michael Foonlan Tsang
(jmft2 at cam dot ac dot uk).

To install, change INSTALL_PREFIX in the Makefile to point to the right
directory (probably "/usr/local" on Unix-like systems.) 

To use, provide the flags -lpnghelpers -lpng.
